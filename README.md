Utilized the LabelImg image annotation tool to meticulously create bounding boxes in the image dataset.
Built and trained Inception-ResNet-V2CNN Model using the weights from ImageNet database for Classification and created a Pipeline to make predictions while using pytesseract OCR extracting text.
Created a Python-Flask based framework Web Application integrated in Number Plate Detection-OCR.

however this is an incomplete project due to limited file size upload (skipped Webapp.py, Object_detection model)
